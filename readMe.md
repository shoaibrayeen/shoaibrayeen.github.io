## Github Pages
**GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pagesâ€™ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.**
