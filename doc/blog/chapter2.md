    During childhood, I used to be so naive that I used to call 'Friends' to everyone. Maybe it was great to be naive or maybe not. Maybe I liked being naive or maybe I wanted to be mature. But it made me really happy during the time. Sometimes, I could not believe that I lost the part which made me happy. But yes, it's a phase of life and I needed to face that.
