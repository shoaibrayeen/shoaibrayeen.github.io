There are two types of People - one who gets love and another who does not. I was kind of the second type.
</p>
A long-time back, When I was doing great, There was a senior in my school. I saw her in Assembly. She was looking so beautiful. It was kind of 'Love at First Sight'. I used to see her every day. After sometimes, I got to know that she was one of my classmate's sister. I got happy. I started talking to the classmate. I started going to his home. When it became usual, she talked to me. I was so happy. Things went accordingly. She used to wake up around 4 AM and we used to talk a lot. We both got feelings for each other and one day, Finally, I proposed her. Sometimes, things don't go in your way and sometimes, luck is used to be at your side. But on the day, It was not at my side. I am happy that it was not. I did not stop talking but I knew that it wasn't good for me as well. Later on, I got to know that she liked someone else. I started helping her instead of getting her by my side. They both seemed so happy with one another. In love, someone is always gonna hurt. It was neither of them.
