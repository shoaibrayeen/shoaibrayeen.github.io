When we want to learn a new programming language, we often think how to start and where to start. The best way to learn anything is by your own, and the best time to start is right now.

I suggest the following steps :

1. Read the documentation of the language
2. Install the tool(s) for the language in your laptop/PC
3. Find some useful links online such as [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/)
4. Read syntax carefully
5. Read some examples that might give you some idea how to write a program
6. Practice some basics programs by your own

That's one of the ways to learn the programming language. You can do more practice after getting an idea about how to write program and that would be helpful in learning process.
