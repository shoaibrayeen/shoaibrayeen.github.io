When we want to learn a new programming language, we often think how to start and where to start. The best way to learn anything is by your own , and the best time to start is right now.

I would like to suggest following steps :

- Read the documentation of the language.
- Install the tool(s) for the language in your laptop/PC.
- Find some useful links online such as [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/).
- Read syntax of the language carefully.
- Read some examples that might give you an idea about how to write a program.
- Practice some basic programs by your own.

That's one of the ways to learn the programming language(s). You can do more by practicing some programs and that would take you one step ahead in learning process.
