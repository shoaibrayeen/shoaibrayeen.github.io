Actions on google let you extend the functionality of the Google Assistant with Actions. Actions let users get things done through a conversational interface that can range from a quick command to turn on some lights or a longer conversation, such as playing a trivia game.

The following Google Actions are developed by me -

- [Brain Teaser](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000f87db14c78) - Trivia on Data Structure Concepts
- [Red Relation](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000007832c77e08) - Trivia on Blood Relation Concepts
- [Country Abbr Trivia](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000ca2b057b79) - Trivia on Country and their Abbreviation
- [Artificial Intelligence Trivia](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000651e98d7e8) - Trivia game on Artificial Intelligence
