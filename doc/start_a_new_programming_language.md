Possibly for learning a new programming language , we often think how to start and where to start. The best way to learn anything is by your own.
The following steps need to follow :

2. Install the tool(s) for the language in your laptop/PC
3. Find some useful links online such as [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/)
4. Read syntax carefully
5. Read some examples that might give you some idea how to write a program
